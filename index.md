I am a physicist by training, interested in using tools from physics, maths and computer science to solve real-world problems.

You can contact me via [sarah.goethals@hotmail.fr](mailto:sarah.goethals@hotmail.fr) and look at my [CV](https://sagoethals.github.io/cv/) and my [publications](https://sagoethals.github.io/publications/) to know more about my academic work.
