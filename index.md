I am a physicist by training, interested in using tools from physics, maths and computer science to solve real-world problems. During my master I worked on the dynamics of neuron populations in the cerebral cortex. Afterwards I got interested in the influence of neuron’s shape on **electrical signals generation in the brain**. I investigated this relationship theoretically and experimentally during my **PhD at the interface between physics and neuroscience**. For more details see my [thesis](https://sagoethals.github.io/assets/docs/thèse_Sarah_Goethals.pdf) or my [publications](https://sagoethals.github.io/publications/).

For many years, I am also very concerned about **climate change and its consequences**. I am volunteering to raise awareness about greenhouse gases emissions, to fight against projects that damage the environement and for the transition to a low-carbon economy. In these lines, among other things, I founded a [committee](https://laplaine.jimdofree.com/) to preserve a green space in Brussels, I organized a one-day workshop at the Cité Universitaire de Paris about energy transition (participants: Enerccop, Energie Partagée, Yves Cochet, Greenspeace) and I am volunteering in The Shifters, an association that supports [The Shift Project](https://theshiftproject.org/).

Now I want to continue using theoretical tools to contribute to reducing greenhouse gases emissions and to the **transition to a low-carbon society**. I want to put my time and energy in sectors in which actions can be taken now to reduce our carbon footprint. Many things can be undertaken without the development of new technologies. For instance, we know how to make buildings more energy-efficient or how to improve energy efficiency in industrial facilities. Both these sectors represent a large proportion of the Franch carbon footprint and, in my opinion, are much simpler to initiate than, for instance, a massive change of behavior within the population.
